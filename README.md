# Weather Data Engineering Project

### Technical Description in non-technical terms
The purpose of this data project is to demonstrate how weather data from multiple cities in the U.S. gets extracted or fetched from an open source (specifically an API - Application Programming Interface), transformed or converted into the correct format, and finally loaded into a Postgre SQL database and into a Google Sheet (required step for data visualization with Tableau). The "Extraction Transforming & Loading" - ETL process mentioned previously was completed with Python programming language. Additional processes include the automation of workflow, and the use of several external technologies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Airflow, Azure Data Studio, Docker & Google Developement software.    consists of multiple Python scripts
